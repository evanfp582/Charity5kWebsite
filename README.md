# Turtle Suicide Prevention 5k Website


## About 
A website that will be used to host the Turtle Suicide Prevention 5k, whenever the event happens next 
The Turtle Suicide Prevention 5k is an event I put together for my community where the proceeds are donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention
In 2019 there were 100+ runners, 10+ volunteers, and $2900 was donated
In 2020 and 2021 it was unfortunetly cancelled due to Covid-19
## Running and installing the application

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
